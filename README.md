Business Problem:

The healthcare domain holds immense significance in the market due to its direct impact on individuals' lives. Consequently, remaining proactive in this area is crucial. Money plays a pivotal role, especially considering the potentially exorbitant costs of treatment. For individuals without insurance coverage, this can lead to challenging financial circumstances. Medical insurance companies, too, aim to minimize risks by * optimizing insurance costs *, recognizing that maintaining good health ultimately lies in the hands of each individual. Adopting healthy habits, such as a balanced diet and regular exercise, significantly reduces the likelihood of falling ill. 💼💡💸

Goal & Objective:

The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using data that provides the optimum insurance cost for an individual. You must use the health and habit-related parameters for the estimated cost of insurance

Target variable: insurance_cost (continuous nature) 📈💰

** Data Insights ** 📊🔍

The dataset doesn't contain any duplicate values ❌🔁
The dataset contains 25000 entries with 24 features and variables 'bmi' & 'Year_last_admitted' has null values 📊🔢🔍

Distribution (Histogram) 📊📊
Variable 'visit_doctor_last_1_year', 'bmi', and 'insurance_cost' are right-skewed ➡️📏📏
Variable daily_avg_steps & weight follow slightly a normal distribution 📏🔔📈
Variable 'fat_percentage' is slightly left-skewed ⬅️📏📏

Outlier (Boxplot) – Using IQR 📊📊
Variable 'regular_checkup_last year', 'visited_doctor_last_1_year', 'daily_avg_steps, and bmi have outliers 📊📉🚫

Frequency count on categorical column (count plot) 📊📊
