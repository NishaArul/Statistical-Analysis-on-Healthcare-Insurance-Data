Predictive Modeling - Insurance Cost

Level: Beginner to Intermediate 
Project Name: HEALTHCARE INSURANCE COST ANALYSIS
Tool: Python
Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
File Type: Data.csv

Business Problem: The healthcare domain holds immense significance in the market due to its direct impact on individuals' lives. Consequently, remaining proactive in this area is crucial. Money plays a pivotal role, especially considering the potentially exorbitant costs of treatment. For individuals without insurance coverage, this can lead to challenging financial circumstances. Medical insurance companies, too, aim to minimize risks by * optimizing insurance costs *, recognizing that maintaining good health ultimately lies in the hands of each individual. Adopting healthy habits, such as a balanced diet and regular exercise, significantly reduces the likelihood of falling ill.

Goal & Objective: The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using data that provides the optimum insurance cost for an individual. You have to use the health and habit-related parameters for the estimated cost of insurance
- Target variable: insurance_cost (continuous nature)

Insights
The dataset doesn't contain any duplicate values
The dataset contains 25000 entries with 24 features and variables 'bmi' & 'Year_last_admitted' has null values

Distribution (Histogram)
•	Variable 'vist_doctor_last_1_year', 'bmi' and 'insurance_cost' are right skewed

•	Variable daily_avg_steps & weight follow slightly a normal distribution

•	Variable 'fat_percentage' is slightly left-skewed

Outlier (Boxplot) – Using IQR
•	Variable 'regular_checkup_last year', 'visted_doctor_last_1_year', 'daily_avg_steps and bmi has outliers'

Frequency count on categorical column (countplot)
•	Students and business people exercise more than salaried individuals.

•	People who do not participate in adventure sports exercise more than others.

•	Those who exercise regularly have a lower risk of past heart disease.

•	Those who exercise regularly have a lower risk of other past health issues.

•	People who exercise fall into cholesterol ranges of 125-150 and 150-175, while those who exercise less have the highest cholesterol range of 225-250.

•	Males tend to exercise more than females.

•	Non-smokers and individuals with unknown smoking history exercise more compared to former smokers and frequent smokers.

•	Hospitals located in Bhuvaneshwar, Jaipur, Mangalapur, and Bangalore customers exercise more frequently, while hospitals in Pune and Surat exercise less.

•	Customers without secondary insurance coverage exercise more than those with secondary coverage.

•	People who never consume alcohol and those who drink alcohol occasionally exercise more than regular alcohol consumers.

Correlation (Heatmap)
•	The weight variable and the insurance_cost target variable are strongly positively related.

•	The Year_last_admitted variable and the insurance_cost target variable are strongly negatively related.

•	The weight_change_in_last_one_year and Year_last_admitted independent variables have a slight positive correlation.

•	The year_last_admitted and weight-independent variables have a strong negative correlation.
