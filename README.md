# 🏥 BUSINESS PROBLEM
The healthcare domain holds immense significance in the market due to its direct impact on individuals' lives. Consequently, remaining proactive in this area is crucial. Money plays a pivotal role, especially considering the potentially exorbitant costs of treatment. For individuals without insurance coverage, this can lead to challenging financial circumstances. Medical insurance companies, too, aim to minimize risks by optimizing insurance costs, recognizing that maintaining good health ultimately lies in the hands of each individual. Adopting healthy habits, such as a balanced diet and regular exercise, significantly reduces the likelihood of falling ill.

# 🎯 GOAL & OBJECTIVE
The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using data that provides the optimum insurance cost for an individual. You must use the health and habit-related parameters for the estimated cost of insurance.

	*Target variable: insurance_cost (continuous nature)*
